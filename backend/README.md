![example workflow](https://github.com/omranlm/TDB/actions/workflows/backend_build.yml/badge.svg)

## Backend is created with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
This project was bootstrapped with  [Geodjango Template](https://github.com/itskshitiz321/geodjangotemplate.git)
#### For Quickly Getting Started
**Note:** Depending upon your OS and Env installation will vary, This project tightly depends on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) with GPU support so accordingly build your development environment
### Install Python3, pip and virtualenv first
##### Skip this, step if you already have one
    sudo apt-get install python3
    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
    sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
##### Create your virtual env
    virtualenv env
    source ./env/bin/activate

##### Setup Basemodels (Ramp Supported Currently)
- Install git lfs
```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

- Clone Ramp Basemodel
```
git clone https://github.com/radiantearth/model_ramp_baseline.git
```

- Clone Ramp - Code
Note: This clone location will be your RAMP_HOME
```
git clone https://github.com/kshitijrajsharma/ramp-code-fAIr.git ramp-code
```

- Copy Basemodel checkpoint to ramp-code
```
cp -r model_ramp_baseline/data/input/checkpoint.tf ramp-code/ramp/checkpoint.tf
```


- Remove basemodel repo we don't need it anymore
```
rm -rf model_ramp_baseline
```
- Install numpy
Numpy needs to be installed before gdal
```
pip install numpy==1.23.5
```

- Install gdal and rasetrio
Based on your env : You can either use conda / setup manually on your os
for eg on ubuntu :
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/include/gdal" GDAL==`gdal-config --version`
```

- Install Ramp - Dependecies
```
cd ramp-code && cd colab && make install
```

- For Conda users : You may need to install rtree, gdal , rasterio & imagecodecs separately

```
conda install -c conda-forge rtree
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
conda install -c conda-forge rasterio
conda install -c conda-forge imagecodecs
```

##### Install necessary libraries for fAIr

- Install Tensorflow  from [here] (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) According to your os (Tested Versions : 2.9.2, 2.8.0)

- Upgrade your setuptools before installing fair-utilities

```
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

- Install fAIr Utilities
```
pip install hot-fair-utilities==1.0.41
```

**Remember In order to run fAIr , You need to configure your PC with tensorflow - GPU Support**

You can check your GPU by :

```
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```


- Install psycopg2
Again based on your os/env you can do manual installation
for eg : on ubuntu :
```
sudo apt-get install python3-psycopg2
```

- Install redis server on your pc

```
sudo apt install redis
```

- Install pdm for dependency management

```
pip install pdm
```

- Finally install project dependencies

```
pdm install
```

### Make sure you have postgresql installed with postgis extension enabled


#### Configure .env:
    Create .env in the root backend project , and add the credentials as provided on .env_sample , Export your secret key and database url to your env

    Export your database url
    ```
    export DATABASE_URL=postgis://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ai
    ```

    You will need more env variables (Such as Ramp home, Training Home) that can be found on ```.sample_env```

#### Now change your username, password and db name in settings.py accordingly to your database
    python manage.py makemigrations login core
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
### Now server will be available in your 8000 port on web, you can check out your localhost:8000/admin for admin panel
To login on admin panel, create your superuser and login with your credentials restarting the server

    python manage.py createsuperuser

## Authentication
fAIr uses oauth2.0 Authentication using [osm-login-python](https://github.com/kshitijrajsharma/osm-login-python)
1. Get your login Url
    Hit ```/api/v1/auth/login/ ```
    - URL will give you login URL which you can use to provide your osm credentials and authorize fAIr
    - After successful login  you will get access-token that you can use across all osm login required endpoints in fAIr
2. Check authentication by getting back your data
    Hit ```/api/v1/auth/me/```
    - URL requires access-token as header and in return you will see your osm username, id and image url


## Start celery workers

-  Start celery workers

```
celery -A aiproject worker --loglevel=debug -n my_worker
```

- Monitor using flower
if  you are using redis as result backend, api supports both options django / redis
You can start flower to start monitoring your tasks
```
celery -A aiproject  --broker=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0 flower
```

## Run Tests

```
python manage.py test
```


# Build fAIr with Docker for Development
- Install all the required drivers for your graphics to access it from containers, and check your graphics and drivers with ```nvidia-smi``` . Up to now only nvidia is Supported
- Follow docker_sample_env to create ```.env``` file in your dir
- Build the Image

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```
- Once the image is build, Open the API container terminal and run the migrations
