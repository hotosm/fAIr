## Architectural Decisions

The `architecture` folder comprises of subfolders and markdowns that documents the architectural decisions made when deciding on the tools used in developing this project. The template used is based on the simple and popular template -- [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), however slightly modified to include the **Date** of the decision. The folder is updated continually when decision making need arises until the end of the project.

## Folder Arrangement

We follow the recommendations from Michael Nygard (quoted below) in the folder arrangement.

> ADRs will be numbered sequentially and monotonically. Numbers will not be reused.

> If a decision is reversed, we will keep the old one around, but mark it as superseded. (It's still relevant to know that it was the decision, but is no longer the decision.)


In the `architecture` folder there are subfolders for each decision making. In each subfolders, there are ADRs numbered sequentially. Also the numbers are reflected in the _Title_ when you open the ADR.
