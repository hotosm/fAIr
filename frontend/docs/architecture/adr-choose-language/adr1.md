# Architecture Decision Record 1: Use Typescript for Development

Date: 10/09/2024

# Context

We are building a web application that requires strong type-checking to reduce runtime errors and improve the overall developer experience. The project will be developed in React, where maintainability and scalability are key concerns.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for type safety to catch errors during development.
- Improved developer tooling with autocompletion and refactoring support.
- Compatibility with existing React ecosystem and team expertise in TypeScript.

## Considered Options

- Use [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) with prop-types for basic type checking.
- Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for stronger, compile-time type checking.

# Decision

We will use TypeScript for this React project to ensure better maintainability, reduce bugs, and take advantage of static type-checking.

# Status

Accepted.

# Consequences

This decision increases the learning curve for developers not familiar with TypeScript but will result in better code quality and fewer runtime errors.
