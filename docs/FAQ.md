**Q : What types of data can I use with fAIr?**

A : fAIr primarily works with satellite imagery and aerial photographs. You can use various types of imagery sources which compiles with opensource imagery license to perform mapping tasks using the AI models provided. The documentation provides information on the compatible data formats and recommended data sources.

<hr>

**Q : Can I customize the AI models in fAIr for my specific needs?**

A : Yes, fAIr is designed to be customizable. The toolkit provides instructions and guidelines on how to train and fine-tune models with your own datasets. This allows you to adapt the models to suit your specific mapping requirements and improve their performance on your target areas or features of interest.

<hr>

**Q : Are there any limitations to using fAIr?**

A : While fAIr offers powerful AI models, it's important to note that the accuracy of the results may vary depending on the quality and resolution of the input imagery and the complexity of the mapping task. Some tasks may require additional manual editing or validation. It's recommended to review the documentation and understand the limitations of each model before use.
